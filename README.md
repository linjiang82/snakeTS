# snakeTS

A snake game in React and Typescript

Usage: yarn start

The demo is not created by CRA instead started from empty and gradually added required packages, in this way I learnt more regarding yarn, webpack, babel configurations.

It is a practice demo, also between a game and a regular web page such as ecommerce, the focus of the programming is slightly different, such as how to structure the classes, how to solve resposiveness, the order of components rendering etc.
